# The Spectacular Space Adventure
The Spectacular Space Adventure is a command line game written in Python. This was my final project for Hackbright Academy's Prep Course.

Make your way through space as you attempt to meet up with your friend on another planet, only to get sidetracked along the way. What decisions will you make, and will they lead you to success or an untimely demise?
